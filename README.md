IMPORTANT 
- I am Student and these are just my personal Notes, while I have checked them for errors I cant confirm that they are 100% error free 

- These are not based on the exact syllabus of VWO Math B, so some content might be lacking or irrelevant

- I would recommend if you do use these notes to only use them as a quick guide for some stuff. Please rely primarily on formal study methods.
